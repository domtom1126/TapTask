# TapTask
Tap to get your tasks done

I remember there was a task app that had a satisfying on click to complete functionality. I can't remember the name of it and if I did find it I'm sure I'd have to buy it. The idea is simple enough, a button, that completes a progress bar on click. So I'm gonna make it.
